        <article>
           <P> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</P>
<P>This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.    </P>

    <h1>javascrpit and java:</h1>
    <p>JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with proven tools for building scalable, interactive web applications. This module gives you some fundamental background knowledge about how client-side frameworks work and how they fit into your toolset, before moving on to a series of tutorials covering some of today's most popular ones.</p>
    <p2>An overview of the basic syntax and semantics of JavaScript for those coming from other programming languages to get up to speed.</p2>
<P3>The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published.</P3>

<div class="section-4">
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
</div>

<div class="content-box">
    <div class="content">
        <p>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }<p>

    </div>
</div>

<div class="section-6">
    <h1>Varaibles:</h1>
    <p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.</p>
    <p>In this example pressing the button runs some code. The first line pops a box up on the screen that asks the reader to enter their name, and then stores the value in a variable. The second line displays a welcome message that includes their name, taken from the variable value and the third line displays that name on the page.</p>
    <p>Variables just make sense, and as you learn more about JavaScript they will start to become second nature.</p>
